Scaling techniques using KDD Cup 1999 IDS dataset
===========================================================================
The following examples demonstrate various scaling techniques for a dataset
in which classes are extremely imbalanced with heavily skewed features


--- Shape
	Row count:	 145581
	Column count:	 32

--- Row count by attack_category
	normal: 87828 (60.329%)
	dos: 54572 (37.486%)
	probe: 2130 ( 1.463%)
	r2l: 999 ( 0.686%)
	u2r: 52 ( 0.036%)
