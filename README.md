# üîç KDD Cup 1999 Network Intrusion Detection System

A comprehensive machine learning framework for network intrusion detection using the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.

## üìã Description

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for analyzing network traffic and detecting intrusions using the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. The framework implements various preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and machine learning models to classify network connections as normal or malicious (with further categorization of attack types).

The KDD Cup 1999 dataset is a widely used benchmark for intrusion detection systems, containing a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Missingno

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow xgboost matplotlib seaborn missingno
   ```
3. Download the KDD Cup 1999 dataset (a 10% subset is included in the `data` directory)
4. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

## üìä Usage

The framework is organized as a pipeline of Python scripts that can be run sequentially:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   ```
   python preprocessing.py
   ```
   This script loads the raw dataset, cleans it, transforms categorical features, and performs initial analysis.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   ```
   python featureselection.py
   ```
   This script applies various feature selection techniques and evaluates their performance.

3. **Scaling**:
   ```
   python scaling.py
   ```
   This script applies different scaling methods to the features and evaluates their impact.

4. **Sampling**:
   ```
   python sampling.py
   ```
   This script applies different sampling techniques to handle class imbalance.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   ```
   python xgboostBinary.py  # For binary classification with XGBoost
   python annMLPBinary.py   # For binary classification with neural networks
   python annMLPMultiClass.py  # For multi-class classification with neural networks
   ```
